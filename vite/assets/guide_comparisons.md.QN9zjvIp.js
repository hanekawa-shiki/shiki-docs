In terms of scope, it&#39;s closer to a Preact meta framework, with the same emphasis on compact size as Preact itself. If you are using Preact, WMR is likely going to offer a more fine-tuned experience.</p><h2 id="web-dev-server" tabindex="-1">@web/dev-server <a class="header-anchor" href="#web-dev-server" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;@web/dev-server&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@web/dev-server</a> (previously <code>es-dev-server</code>) is a great project and Vite 1.0&#39;s Koa-based server setup was inspired by it.</p><p><code>@web/dev-server</code> is a bit lower-level in terms of scope. It does not provide official framework integrations, and requires manually setting up a Rollup configuration for the production build.</p><p>Overall, Vite is a more opinionated / higher-level tool that aims to provide a more out-of-the-box workflow. That said, the <code>@web</code> umbrella project contains many other excellent tools that may benefit Vite users as well.</p><h2 id="snowpack" tabindex="-1">Snowpack <a class="header-anchor" href="#snowpack" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Snowpack&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Snowpack</a> was also a no-bundle native ESM dev server, very similar in scope to Vite. The project is no longer being maintained. The Snowpack team is now working on <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Astro</a>, a static site builder powered by Vite. The Astro team is now an active player in the ecosystem, and they are helping to improve Vite.</p><p>Aside from different implementation details, the two projects shared a lot in terms of technical advantages over traditional tooling. Vite&#39;s dependency pre-bundling is also inspired by Snowpack v1 (now <a href="https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/esinstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>esinstall</code></a>).
